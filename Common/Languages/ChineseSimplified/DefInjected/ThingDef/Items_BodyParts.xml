	<!-- EN: A fake Mousekin ear sewn from cloth.\n\nMousekins take great pride in their large rounded ears, as their presence (or absence) greatly affects their standing in Mousekin society. Those who have lost their natural ears through injury or disease wear fake ears to hide their humiliating disfigurement. -->

	<!-- EN: A fake Mousekin tail made from cloth twisted and braided into rope.\n\nLike ordinary non-humanoid mice, Mousekins use their tails for balance while moving. Those who have lost their natural tails through injury and disease wear fake tails, and while the non-living rope tail does not fully restore their loss of balancing ability, it at least attracts less attention than a stump. -->

	<!-- EN: A biological Mousekin ear, most likely harvested from a dead or unwilling Mousekin.\n\nBesides allowing Mousekins to pick up quiet, distant sounds, large rounded ears represent a Mousekin’s personal honor, dignity and standing in their society, and this replacement ear fully restores their loss of hearing ability as well as their social status. -->
	<Mousekin_BodyPartEar.description>一只天然的白鼠族耳朵，极有可能是从死去或不情愿的白鼠族身上收获的。\n\n除了能让白鼠族听到低沉、遥远的声音外，又大又圆的耳朵代表了白鼠族个人的荣誉和尊严。因此，这个移植的耳朵完全恢复了他们的听力损失和社会地位。</Mousekin_BodyPartEar.description>
