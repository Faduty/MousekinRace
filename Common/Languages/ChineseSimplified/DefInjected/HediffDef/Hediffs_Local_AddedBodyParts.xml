	<!-- EN: A fake Mousekin ear sewn from cloth.\n\nMousekins take great pride in their large rounded ears, as their presence (or absence) greatly affects their standing in Mousekin society.

	<!-- EN: A fake Mousekin tail made from cloth twisted and braided into rope.\n\nLike ordinary non-humanoid mice, Mousekins use their tails for balance while moving. Those who have lost their natural tails through injury and disease wear fake tails, and while the non-living rope tail does not fully restore their loss of balancing ability, it at least attracts less attention than a stump. -->
