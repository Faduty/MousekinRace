					Set player and NPC faction relations between Ratkins and Mousekins 
					
					- Mousekins are generally uncomfortable with Ratkins for having cross-dressing males, while Ratkins generally hold Mousekins in contempt for their short height
					
					- This is further exemplified by the rivalry between Mousekin and Ratkin Kingdoms, as both have competing claims over the right to rule over all humanoid rodentkinds; in particular, the Mousekin Kingdom clergy consider Ratkins "heretics" for their unnatural genetically-engineered human-rat nature, while Ratkins believe their human-ness makes them superior to Mousekins
					
					- On the other hand, Ratkins are relatively friendlier towards Independent Mousekins and Rodemani Gypsies, as the latter Mousekins do not agree with the Mousekin Kingdom's church doctrine
					
					- Faction tensions aside, individual Mousekins and Ratkins are not xenophobic towards each other, to allow players to decide whether or not to get involved in the feud
