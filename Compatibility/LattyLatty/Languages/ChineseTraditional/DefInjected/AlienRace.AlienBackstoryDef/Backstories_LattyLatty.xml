	<!-- EN: After a deadly epidemic caused by a centuries-old tradition of sex-selective inbreeding swept throughout the Ratkin Kingdom, [PAWN_nameDef] fled as [PAWN_possessive] home village collapsed into anarchy, but was shunned by countless human settlements for spurious reasons, before eventually and reluctantly seeking refuge in an Independent Mousekin town.\n\nWhile [PAWN_pronoun] was able to help out on the town's farms, [PAWN_possessive] poor health, limited understanding of English, and personal disdain for "annoying and short talking rats" made [PAWN_possessive] difficult to deal with. -->
	<Mousekin_Ratkin_Adulthood_RefugeeA.description>在一場由數百年歷史的性別選擇性近親繁殖傳統引發的致命流行病席捲整個鼠娘王國之後，[PAWN_nameDef]隨著[PAWN_possessive]家鄉陷入無政府狀態而逃離，但由於虛假原因而被無數人類住區所迴避，最終還是不情願地在一個獨立的白鼠族城鎮尋求庇護。\n\n雖然[PAWN_pronoun]能夠在鎮上的農場幫忙，但[PAWN_possessive]健康狀況不佳、對英語的理解有限、以及個人對「短小而煩人的會說話的老鼠」的蔑視，使她很難相處。</Mousekin_Ratkin_Adulthood_RefugeeA.description>
