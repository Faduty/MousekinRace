	<!-- EN: After a deadly epidemic caused by a centuries-old tradition of sex-selective inbreeding swept throughout the Ratkin Kingdom, [PAWN_nameDef] fled as [PAWN_possessive] home village collapsed into anarchy, but was shunned by countless human settlements for spurious reasons, before eventually and reluctantly seeking refuge in an Independent Mousekin town.\n\nWhile [PAWN_pronoun] was able to help out on the town's farms, [PAWN_possessive] poor health, limited understanding of English, and personal disdain for "annoying and short talking rats" made [PAWN_possessive] difficult to deal with. -->
