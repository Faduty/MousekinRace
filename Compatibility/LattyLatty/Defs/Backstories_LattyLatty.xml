		<title>Ratkin refugee</title>
		<titleShort>refugee</titleShort>
		<description>After a deadly epidemic caused by a centuries-old tradition of sex-selective inbreeding swept throughout the Ratkin Kingdom, [PAWN_nameDef] fled as [PAWN_possessive] home village collapsed into anarchy, but was shunned by countless human settlements for spurious reasons, before eventually and reluctantly seeking refuge in an Independent Mousekin town.\n\nWhile [PAWN_pronoun] was able to help out on the town's farms, [PAWN_possessive] poor health, limited understanding of English, and personal disdain for "annoying and short talking rats" made [PAWN_possessive] difficult to deal with.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was one of the few survivors of a village in the Ratkin Kingdom that was completely obliterated by a Ratkin Demoman who had a psychotic break during a military training exercise.\n\nA passing Rodemani nomad caravan later found [PAWN_objective] and [PAWN_possessive] compatriots wandering dazed and confused far from home, and brought them to the nearest Independent Mousekin town for convalescence.\n\nThis traumatic experience left [PAWN_nameDef] with a lifelong fear of violence and fire.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] did not share [PAWN_possessive] compatriots' collective prejudice towards "annoying and short talking rats", and was exiled from [PAWN_possessive] home village for daring to befriend a passing Mousekin traveler.\n\n[PAWN_pronoun] subsequently accepted an invitation by the traveler to come live in the Independent Mousekin town he came from, where [PAWN_pronoun] helped the Mousekin townsfolk negotiate fairer trade deals with human trade caravans with [PAWN_possessive] charisma and unusually good command of the English language.</description>
